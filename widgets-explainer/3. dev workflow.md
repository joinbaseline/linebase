# Dev Workflow

I strongly recommend building widgets in android studio + xcode with separate projects from the expo project. When done, copy the files over to the iOS and android folders, run a new dev build, and see the result. Always prebuild first to avoid errors using up your expo builds. 

Note you can also do npx expo run, and then open the ios and android folders in xcode/android studio respectively. If you're careful you can do this, but note that any local prebuild will wipe all changes. You only make that mistake once before the tears appear. Personally, I think expo needs to improve on this mechanism and my approach is to keep widgets in separate projects and copy the files over. You may prefer the expo route, if you're brave.
