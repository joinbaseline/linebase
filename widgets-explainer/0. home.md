# Designing Widgets

CTRL + SHIFT + V in vscode to see this in preview.

The strategy file provides my recommended approach, along with guideline information for android and iOS. Files 2 + 3 are code samples from my UK Zero project. The android file shows how to request data using coroutine and only does so based on the last cached at timestamp, to reduce server stress. iOS has a similar approach, but uses timeline provider. Please keep this code to yourself :)

Only standard basic widgets are currently supported properly (homescreen + lockscreen). If you need a live update widget then I will need to do some work in the library as there's an open ticket to investigate + complete.
